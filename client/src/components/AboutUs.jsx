          Consider the long and sordid history of electoral fraud around the world. No major population has been immune to the manipulation of collective decision-making processes. In severe cases, the possibility of electoral fraud has de-legitimized the winning party and undermined trust in governing bodies.

          BlockBallot provides a secure, electronic way to establish a chain of custody - a chronological paper trail - that traces the data that each voter contributes to an election. And because BlockBallot is built on the Ethereum network, election data is publicly accessible and verifiable by a network of peers. (Please note that BlockBallot is in early production and currently operates on the public Rinkeby Testnet. The app will be refactored to operate on the official network in the future).

            In plain terms, think of the blockchain as complex database that any motivated party can access. Copies are stored around the world in a peer-to-peer network. Each element in this database is called a block, and each block is linked to another using cryptography. Information stored in this manner is highly secure and publicly verifiable.

            A smart contract is a digital transaction protocol, or a set of rules and instructions that define and govern different kinds of transactions made on a blockchain network. Although not unique to Ethereum, verstaile smart contract technology is characteristic of the platform.
